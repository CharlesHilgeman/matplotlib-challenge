Inference 1: The drug regimens were extremely variable in what how concentrated the IQR was with Ceftamin's being relatively large and Infubinol's being quite small.

Inference 2: The tumor volume appears to decrease significantly per mouse as time increases.

Inference 3: It seems pretty obvious that tumor volume is strongly, positively correlated to weight in mice.
